C++ Operating system
My computer teacher said I know a shit.
I was bored clicking my code together with "scratch",
instead I was interested in Game-Dev in C++ and Web-development 
using html, css, javascript and php. 
Now I know much more and I love low-level, high-level, back-end &
front-end dev

OS: 
  ( Arch- )Linux

Programming Language: 
  It depends on the problem ( sooo many... )
  --My heart compiles C++

I use vim as my texteditor/ IDE including:
  the GCC ( gnu compilers ), 
  gdb, qemu, make, bash
